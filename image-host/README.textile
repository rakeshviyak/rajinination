h1. Google AppEngine Image Hosting

Purposely simple image management application for use on Google AppEngine.

h2. Background

I like to add the odd image to a blog post now and then, but hate having to upload and resize images so they fit nicely. This simple application scratches that itch. Simply upload and resize images and then host them from AppEngine. It was also the perfect opportunity to play with the Image API.

h2. Usage

For the most part it's just a matter of deploying to AppEngine which I won't cover here. Read the official documentation for details.

By default images are viewable by everyone but the upload panel is only available to the administration for your account. If you want to make that available to any registered user then change the following line in the app.yaml configuration file.

pre. - url: /.*
  script: backend.py
  login: admin

To this:

pre. - url: /.*
  script: backend.py
  login: required

h2. Limitations

It currently uses keys to identify resources, which has the advantage of being very easy to implement and the disadvantage of making sharing data between instances impossible. This means if you upload images locally to test things out you'll have to upload them again when you deploy to App Engine. I might fix that if I get bored or it I start to make extensive use of it.

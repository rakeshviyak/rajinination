   <!-- Internet Explorer has a "feature" called "friendly error
        messages" that defaults to being turned on, where it detects
        certain remote error conditions (among them, 404s) such that
        the response (presumably an error descriptor page) is less
        than some size (512 bytes for 404s). If that happens, it
        replaces the remote error message with a more "friendly"
        description of the error, which obscures the server's error
        message. Historically, this is because Apache's and IIS's
        error messages are famously non-helpful, and were less than
        that minimum size. This unnecessarily verbose comment serves
        only to cause this page (whose status code may be a 404, set
        in toolbar.py:GET_s) to go over that minimum size, so that we
        can force our content to be shown to IE users with "friendly
        error messages", even on braindead browsers. -->

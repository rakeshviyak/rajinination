  <h1>Request Help</h1>

  <p>
    reddit is a community, and as such there are a lot of outlets to get help for what ails you.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Making a press inquiry?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/help/press">Get our press contact details</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Are your submissions not showing up?  Subreddit marked as spam?  Is the spam filter acting up?</dt>
    <dd>
      &#32;<a href="/message/compose?to=${g.admin_message_acct|u}">Send a private message to the admins.</a>&#32;(We really do want to help)
    </dd>
    <dt>Got a feature request?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/r/ideasfortheadmins">Post it to our development community so the admins can see it</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Got a bug report?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/r/bugs/">Check /r/bugs for other people with the same problem, or submit your own bug report.</a></dd>
    <dt>Are you a new moderator?  Having trouble staying out of the fray? Need advice?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/r/modhelp">There's a reddit for that</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Want to advertise but don't know how?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/ad_inq">The instructions are here</a>.</dd>
    <dt>General questions?  Need help?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/r/help">There's a reddit for that, too</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Crazy, or just feel like ranting at us?</dt>
    <% r = random.randint(0,2) %>
    %if r == 0:
      <dd><a href="/r/null">Here is a soothing place to get your aggressions out</a>.</dd>
    %elif r == 1:
      <dd><a href="/important" onclick="return false">Just click here until you feel better (like a stress ball)</a>.</dd>
    %elif r == 2:
      <dd><a href="about:blank" target="_blank">There are always other options</a>.</dd>
    %endif
  </dl>
<p>
  Or, if none of these solve your problem,&#32;
  <a href="#" onclick="$('#feedback-form').slideDown(function(){$(this).find('input[type=text]:first').focus();}); return false;">
    send a message to our feedback.
  </a>

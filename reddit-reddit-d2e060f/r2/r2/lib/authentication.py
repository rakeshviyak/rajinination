"""Authentication providers for setting c.user on every request.

This system is intended to allow pluggable authentication for intranets etc. It
is not intended to cover all login/logout functionality and in non-cookie
scenarios those are probably nonsensical to allow user control of (i.e.
single-signon on an intranet doesn't generally allow new account creation on a
single website.)
